# Open-ended questions: for these, make assumptions and clearly state them when answering the question.
# Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
/* 
 * 	Power users at Fetch are those who engage frequently with the platform, make high-value purchases, 
and have long-term engagement, typically over 6 months to 1 year. 
They regularly purchase from high-demand categories like Dips & Salsa and offer repeat business through multiple transactions. 

	To identify power users, Fetch can analyze data such as purchase frequency, average transaction size, and customer lifecycle. 
Segmenting users based on these metrics can help pinpoint the most valuable and active customers.
*/

# Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?
/* Based on the analysis shows that leading brand "YOUTHEORY" in the Dips & Salsa category is 
 * identified as the brand with the highest total sales from transactions. 
 * 
 * The result shows that "YOUTHEORY" is the top brand in terms of sales, followed by "BRANK NOT KNOWN".
 * However, this suggests that there may be missing or incomplete brand information in the data, 
 * which should be addressed to clarify the actual leading brand.
